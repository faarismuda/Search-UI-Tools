## Notes

- The extension is designed to work specifically on the domain `searchcenter.gdn-app.com`. Some features will be disabled if the extension is used on other domains.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions enabled for the extension to function correctly.
- The extension uses Chrome's storage API to save the state of the "Highlight Ads" and "Back To Top" features.
- The extension has not been tested on macOS.
- The extension has not been tested on browsers other than Chromium-based browsers.
- This extension is not intended to speed up the audit process, but rather to make it more accurate.

## Known Issues

- ~~**Sort Price Functionality**: Occasionally, the sort price functionality does not work as expected. Sometimes, products are sorted into separate groups, resulting in category A being sorted and then category B being sorted, rather than a fully ordered list. The cause of this issue is currently unknown, and a solution has not yet been identified.~~ FIXED 13/03/25 :D
